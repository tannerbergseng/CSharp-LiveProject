C# code summary, for the past 2 weeks I have been apart of a team working with the MVC code first approach, during the two weeks I have implemented a class model and controller with the corresponding views to let users schedule a vacation day and send that data to the database, the data included, a start date and end date, vacation type, and the ID of the user that is signed in, this took me the longest time of any of the stories to get it working properly (about a week) but I was proud with how it turned out. https://github.com/tannerbergseng/c-LiveProject/blob/master/vactation.txt. 

The second story I worked on was just a simple front end fix to the forgot password page to add styling to match the rest of the application and to add a back button to return to the login page, this was all done within the single forgot password view with some simple cshtml codehttps://github.com/tannerbergseng/c-LiveProject/blob/master/forgotpassword.txt

 The third story I took I thought would be an interesting challenge which included a character limit size to the company news page along with a counter to let the user know how many characters they have left to use, the problem before was that the database would accept any amount of characters (Tested with 5 e-books, over half a million words, and over 3 million characters) but with some cshtml and some javascript I was able to add the limit as well as changing the color of the character counter to give some visual aid to the user about how many characters  they have left remaining.
